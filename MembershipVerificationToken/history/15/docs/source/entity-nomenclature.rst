Entity
------

The entity is a smart contract designed to track membership. It is operated by the contract owner, called the
admin. The entity contains information about which ethereum addresses are part of the governance unit.

What is an Entity?
------------------

An entity is a contract which uses non transferable, revocable, boolean quantity tokens to mark
ethereum addresses as members. The contract owner can use assign and revoke functions of the
contract to add and remove members from the entity. Contract allows for instantly checking
whether a certain address is or isn't a member of a certain entity. Different members of the same
entity are not distinguishable on the blockchain. This hides the identity of a user while affirming
their membership.

Who can be an Entity?
---------------------

Any organization which functions on the basis of a membership can use an entity to carry out its
membership management.
Examples: library , citizenship , voter authentication , investor accreditation vendor , stock issuer
wanting to vet it's investors.
