# A Test Case Generation Technique for Smart Contracts

Running smart contracts in a blockchain network comes has the potential to enable business and public policies in an efficient and innovative way. However, software development in an environment that has immutability as one of its cornerstones brings challenges to quality assurance. Recent research has addressed the evaluation of smart contract quality, but most work focus on finding well-known vulnerability issues. There is, therefore, a gap in the literature about the generation of tests for smart contracts. We present a technique to generate test cases based on the expressions found in the source code of smart contracts. An experimental analysis was conducted using forty smart contract projects to compare the branch coverage achieved by the generated tests against the original test suite that was manually coded for the projects. We found out that the tests generated by the technique produce equal or greater coverage in 22 out of the 40 projects. 


Directory "experimental-evalutation": contains the input and output files of each of the 30 executions of each project under test during the experiments and it's coverage report.

Directory "experimental-analysis": contains the data files generated during experiments and the R scripts used in the research results analysis.
