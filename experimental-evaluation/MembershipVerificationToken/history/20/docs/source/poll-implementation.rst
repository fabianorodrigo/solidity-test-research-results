********************************
Poll Implementation
********************************

All the polls implement an abstract contract "BasePoll.sol". It defines the structure of a poll contract.
Please observe the inheritance relationship carefully.

Members vote for a proposal amongst a list. They can also revoke an already cast vote.

Polls are broadly divided into two types:

:UnBound: 
    No time limit. 
    
    No Action defined at end.

    Can be deployed independently (No action contract needed to support).

    Non-Abstract implementation.

:Bound: 
    Time limited. 
    
    Automated actions can be defined at the end of poll. :ref:`action-nomenclature`.

    Not necessarily independent. Contracts with automated action require the existence of 
    automated contracts.

    May be Abstract implementation. (if onPollFinish() is implemented it is non abstract).

UnBound Poll Base
=================

Here is a sample implementation of an unbound poll.


::

  
    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

    import "../Protocol/IElectusProtocol.sol";


    contract BasePoll {
        struct Proposal {
            bytes32 name;
            uint256 voteCount;
        }

        struct Voter {
            bool voted;
            uint8 vote;   // index of the voted proposal
            address delegate;
            uint256 weight;
        }

        mapping(address => Voter) public voters;

        Proposal[] public proposals;
        IElectusProtocol public protocol;

        modifier isCurrentMember() {
            require(protocol.isCurrentMember(msg.sender), "Not an electus member");
            _;
        }

        constructor(address _electusProtocol, bytes32[] _proposalNames) public {
            protocol = IElectusProtocol(_electusProtocol);
            for (uint8 i = 0; i < _proposalNames.length; i++) {
                proposals.push(Proposal({name: _proposalNames[i], voteCount: 0}));
            }
        }

        function vote(uint8 proposal) public;

        function revokeVote() public;

        function onPollFinish(uint8 winningProposal_) internal;
    }


Bound Poll Base
===============
Here is a sample implementation of a bound poll.

::


    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

    import "./BasePoll.sol";
    import "../Ownership/Authorizable.sol";

    //Need to unfreeze all accounts at the end of poll

    contract BasePollBound is BasePoll {
        
        uint public startTime;
        uint public endTime;    

        Authorizable public authorizable;

        modifier checkTime() {
            require(now >= startTime && now <= endTime);
            _;
        }

        modifier isAuthorized() {
            require(authorizable.isAuthorized(msg.sender), "Not enough access rights");
            _;
        }

        constructor(address _electusProtocol, address _authorizable, bytes32[] _proposalNames,
        uint _startTime, uint _endTime) public BasePoll(_electusProtocol, _proposalNames) {        
            authorizable = Authorizable(_authorizable);
            require(_startTime >= now && _endTime > _startTime);
            startTime = _startTime;
            endTime = _endTime;
        }
    }



As of today, 6 categories of polls exist

One person - One Vote
=====================

In this category of polls, each member of entity gets to cast a single vote whose weight is constant

Token weight Uncapped with freeze
=================================

In this category of polls, each member of entity gets to cast a single vote whose weight is proportional to 
the token balance they hold with no cap. When a user casts a vote, his token balance is frozen.


He/she would need to unvote to be able to transfer the tokens

Delegated voting
================

In this category of polls, each member of entity gets to cast a single vote whose weight is constant but
the member can delegate his vote to another person who he believes is a better judge at the topic.
The member can not cast his vote once he delegates it to another.

Karma voting
================

In this category of polls, each member of entity gets to cast a single vote whose weight is constant but
the member can delegate his vote to another person who he believes is a better judge at the topic.
The member can cast his vote even after he delegates it to another. The person to who the vote is delegated to gets his weight increased.
