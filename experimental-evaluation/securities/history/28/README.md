Please note that these contracts were written to accompany our recent paper `The Blueprint of a Functional Security Token` to shed light on the ideas discussed in the paper. These contracts have *not yet been sufficiently tested and audited*, and any on-chain use should be preceded by *substantial testing and a formal audit process*.

Although the contracts have been written in Solidity and are specific to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the algorithmic patterns and constructs contained in the contracts are not unique to solidity and could be implemented in other languages and across other blockchains. Furthermore, as discussed throughout the paper, the contracts require varying amounts of interaction with off-chain technology, which is not provided on this github.
